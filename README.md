  <strong><a href="https://sjmta.org/" target="_blank">SJMTA Website</a></strong> – Redesigned and rebuilt the official site for the South Jersey Music Teachers Association. Replaced the legacy WordPress setup with a custom static site using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. Deployed on Render to eliminate previous hosting costs and simplify maintenance. The result is a faster, responsive, and more modern web experience tailored for music educators and students.
